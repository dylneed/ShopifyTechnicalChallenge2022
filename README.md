# NASA EPIC Photo Library

This project was created in REACT.js using Polaris. The link for the website can be found [here](https://dylneed.github.io/ShopifyTechnicalChallenge2022/), at [https://dylneed.github.io/ShopifyTechnicalChallenge2022/](https://dylneed.github.io/ShopifyTechnicalChallenge2022/).

For the project, since The EPIC Photo Library does not have names that are searchable, I used a date picker to filter results, since that is the only way to search for items on the API.

When clicking on the images, I added a way to view all the data NASA collected about the photo that was accesspible through the API. 

When liking images, I added a page to see all the liked images sorted and together, though each liked image still retained the ability to be unliked on that page.

The EPIC Photo Library is about two days behind when it comes to uploading photos, but the date picker always picks today's date, which is why there is no data for when the app is initially loaded.

The titles and descriptions used, though repetitive, are the only titles and descriptions given by the API (although, for the description, I added the portion mentioning the date).

The app uses the Local Storage feature to keep the liked images in the computer's memory, so it will always remember which images you liked.
